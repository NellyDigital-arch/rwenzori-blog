      Since our founding in 2021, Rwenzori Credit & Savings Group has empowered over 5,000 women, widows, and young mothers through small savings and credit programs. These efforts have helped many start businesses, cover school fees, and escape poverty cycles.

      In this article, we explore stories of women who’ve used our micro-loans to change their lives. From poultry farming to mobile money ventures, these are stories of resilience and growth.

      Our goal is not just financial support, but **community transformation.**
